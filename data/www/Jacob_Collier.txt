Jacob Collier (born 2 August 1994) is a singer, arranger, composer, producer and multi-instrumentalist based in London, England. In 2012, his homemade split-screen video covers of popular songs, such as Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing", began to go viral on YouTube. Since then, he has attracted a worldwide following, accumulating tens of millions of views across multiple social media platforms. Collier's style fuses elements of jazz, a cappella, groove, folk, electronic music, classical music, gospel, soul and improvisation, and often features extreme use of reharmonisation. In 2014, Collier signed to Quincy Jones' management company and began working on his one-man, audio-visual live performance vehicle, designed and built at MIT in Boston. On 1 July 2016, Collier released his debut album, In My Room, which was recorded, arranged, performed and produced entirely by Collier in his home in London. In February 2017, Collier was awarded two Grammys for his arrangements of "Flintstones" and "You And I", both from the album.
