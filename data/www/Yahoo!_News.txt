Yahoo! News originated as an internet-based news aggregator by Yahoo!. Articles originally came from news services such as the Associated Press, Reuters, Fox News, Al Jazeera, ABC News, USA Today, CNN.com, BBC News, etc.
In 2001, Yahoo! News launched the first "most-emailed" page on the web. It was a well-received innovative idea, expanding on how computers could be used to do things in a society.
Yahoo allowed comments for news articles until December 19, 2006, when commentary was disabled. Comments were re-enabled on March 2, 2010. Comments were temporarily disabled between December 10, 2011, and December 15, 2011, due to glitches.
In June 2011, Yahoo! News was rebuilt using an internal content management system called the Yahoo Publishing Platform. The same platform now powers Yahoo! News in the following regions and languages: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, English, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Spanish (US), English (US), Venezuela, Hong Kong, English (India), Marathi, Tamil, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.
By 2011, Yahoo had expanded its focus to include original content, as part of its plans to become a major media organization. Veteran journalists (including Walter Shapiro and Virginia Heffernan) were hired, while the website had a correspondent in the White House press corps for the first time in February 2012. An Amazon-owned marketing data collection company (Alexa) claimed Yahoo! News one of the world's top news sites, at this point.
Plans were made to add a Twitter feed. In November, 2013, Yahoo hired former Today Show and CBS Evening News anchor Katie Couric as Global Anchor of Yahoo! News.
