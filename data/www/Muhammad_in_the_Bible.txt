Arguments that prophecies of Muhammad in the Bible presaged his birth, teachings, and death have formed part of Muslim tradition from the early history of Muhammad’s Ummah (Arabic: أُمَّـة‎‎, Community) although thoroughly discarded as factual falsities by authoritative Christian Doctors of the Church like John of Damascus and Thomas Aquinas who explicitly says that the Biblical Canon fails to foretell Muhammad because "he perverts almost all the testimonies of the Old and New Testaments by making them into fabrications of his own, as can be seen by anyone who examines his law."
Muslim writers have expanded on these viewpoints and have argued that they can specifically identify references to Muhammad in the text of the Bible, both in the Jewish Tanakh and in the Christian New Testament. Several verses in the Qur'an, as well as several Hadiths, state that Muhammad is described in the Bible. The apocryphal Gospel of Barnabas, which explicitly mentions Muhammad, has also been identified as an ancient prediction about the Prophet, but this book is widely recognized by scholars as a fabrication from the Early Modern Age (14th–15th century).
Some Muslim writers argue that expectations of forthcoming prophets existed within the Jewish community from before the lifetime of Jesus through to that of Muhammad, and that Muhammad was the final fulfillment of these expectations. Muslims venerate Jesus and other religious figures, such as Moses and David, as having laid the groundwork for Muhammad’s later efforts.
In terms of Christian perspectives, some notable figures such as Martin Luther and John Calvin have interpreted Muhammad in the context of Bible prophecy as being either the False Prophet or the Antichrist. However, many other Christian figures have taken alternate approaches. In the 1910 Catholic Encyclopedia, holds that "contradictory opinions have been expressed by scholars in the last three centuries" about Muhammad’s "moral character and sincerity" since "Many of these opinions are biased either by an extreme hatred of Islam and its founder or by an extreme admiration, coupled with a hatred of Christianity."
