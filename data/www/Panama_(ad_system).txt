Panama is an online advertising platform created by Yahoo!.
Panama was launched by Yahoo! on 5 February 2007. The Panama team was assembled in mid-2005. The advertising platform was Yahoo’s effort to close the wide gap with Google in the race for search advertising dollars, a fast-growing business then dominated by Google. Customers with accounts already on Yahoo! were transferred to the new system over the following few months.
