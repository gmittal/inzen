The Isle of Wight Festival is a music festival which takes place annually on the Isle of Wight in England. It was originally a counterculture event held from 1968 to 1970.
The 1970 event was by far the largest and most famous of these early festivals and the unexpectedly high attendance levels led, in 1971, to Parliament adding a section to the "Isle of Wight County Council Act 1971", preventing overnight open-air gatherings of more than 5,000 people on the island without a special licence from the council.
The event was revived in 2002.
