Trevor George Smith Jr. (born May 20, 1972), better known by his stage name Busta Rhymes, is an American hip hop recording artist, actor, record producer and record executive. Chuck D of Public Enemy gave him the moniker Busta Rhymes, after NFL wide receiver George "Buster" Rhymes. He is widely known for his outlandish style and fashion sense depicted in several highly innovative music videos as well as his intricate rhyming technique, rapping at a high rate of speed with heavy use of internal rhyme and half rhyme, and to date has received 11 Grammy Award nominations for his musical work.
