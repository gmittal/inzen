The Yale School of Public Health (YSPH) was founded in 1915 by Charles-Edward Amory Winslow and is one of the oldest public health masters programs in the United States. It is consistently rated among the best schools of public health in the country, receiving recent rankings of 3rd for its doctoral program in Epidemiology. YSPH has a unique hybrid existence with the Yale School of Medicine, as it is both a department (established in 1915) within the School of Medicine as well as an independent, CEPH-certified school of public health (established in 1946). According to the school's website, the community benefits greatly from the Yale School of Public Health's dual roles of providing a world–class education as an accredited, fully functioning school, and by conducting cutting–edge, interdisciplinary research through its collaborative departmental partnerships at the School of Medicine and across the Yale campus.
