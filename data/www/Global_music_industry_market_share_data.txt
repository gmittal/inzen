Note that this list ranks markets based on retail value (rather than units) each market generates respectively per year; retail value generated by each market varies from year to year. The figures are based on IFPI annual reports. As all financial data is given in US dollars annual rates of change for all countries other than the United States are heavily influenced by exchange rate fluctuations as well as by actual changes in revenue in local currency terms.
It is important to note that the information presented in this page only accounts for revenue generated from the recorded music industry (recorded music and auxiliary revenues generated by these recordings), and is not reflective of the entirety of the music industry including sectors such as publishing, live music, etc.
