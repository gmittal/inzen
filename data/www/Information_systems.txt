An **information system** ( **IS** ) is an organized system for the
collection, organization, storage and communication of information. More
specifically, it is the study of complementary networks that people and
organizations use to collect, filter, process, create and distribute data.

"An information system (IS) is a group of components that interact to produce
information. It focuses on the internal rather than the external."[1]

A computer information system is a system that a branch of Science composed of
people and computers that processes or interprets information.[2][3][4][5] The
term is also sometimes used in more restricted senses to refer to only the
software used to run a computerized database or to refer to only a computer
system.

**Information Systems** is an academic study of systems with a specific
reference to information and the complementary networks of hardware and
software that people and organizations use to collect, filter, process, create
and also distribute data. An emphasis is placed on an information system
having a definitive boundary, users, processors, storage, inputs, outputs and
the aforementioned communication networks.[6]

Any specific information system aims to support operations, management and
decision-making.[7][8] An information system is the information and
communication technology (ICT) that an organization uses, and also the way in
which people interact with this technology in support of business
processes.[9]

Some authors make a clear distinction between information systems, computer
systems, and business processes. Information systems typically include an ICT
component but are not purely concerned with ICT, focusing instead on the end
use of information technology. Information systems are also different from
business processes. Information systems help to control the performance of
business processes.[10]

Alter[11][12] argues for advantages of viewing an information system as a
special type of work system. A work system is a system in which humans or
machines perform processes and activities using resources to produce specific
products or services for customers. An information system is a work system
whose activities are devoted to capturing, transmitting, storing, retrieving,
manipulating and displaying information.[13]

As such, information systems inter-relate with data systems on the one hand
and activity systems on the other. An information system is a form of
communication system in which data represent and are processed as a form of
social memory. An information system can also be considered a semi-formal
language which supports human decision making and action.

Information systems are the primary focus of study for organizational
informatics.[14]

## Overview[edit]

Silver et al. (1995) provided two views on IS that includes software,
hardware, data, people, and procedures.[15] Zheng provided another system view
of information system which also adds processes and essential system elements
like environment, boundary, purpose, and interactions. The Association for
Computing Machinery defines "Information systems specialists [as] focus[ing]
on integrating information technology solutions and business processes to meet
the information needs of businesses and other enterprises."[16]

There are various types of information systems, for example: transaction
processing systems, decision support systems, knowledge management systems,
learning management systems, database management systems, and office
information systems. Critical to most information systems are information
technologies, which are typically designed to enable humans to perform tasks
for which the human brain is not well suited, such as: handling large amounts
of information, performing complex calculations, and controlling many
simultaneous processes.

Information technologies are a very important and malleable resource available
to executives.[17] Many companies have created a position of chief information
officer (CIO) that sits on the executive board with the chief executive
officer (CEO), chief financial officer (CFO), chief operating officer (COO),
and chief technical officer (CTO). The CTO may also serve as CIO, and vice
versa. The chief information security officer (CISO) focuses on information
security management.

The six components that must come together in order to produce an information
system are: (Information systems are organizational procedures and do not need
a computer or software, this data is erroneous) (IE, an accounting system in
the 1400s using ledger and ink utilizes an information system)

  1. Hardware: The term hardware refers to machinery. This category includes the computer itself, which is often referred to as the central processing unit (CPU), and all of its support equipment. Among the support, equipment are input and output devices, storage devices and communications devices.
  2. Software: The term software refers to computer programs and the manuals (if any) that support them. Computer programs are machine-readable instructions that direct the circuitry within the hardware parts of the system to function in ways that produce useful information from data. Programs are generally stored on some input/output medium, often a disk or tape.
  3. Data: Data are facts that are used by programs to produce useful information. Like programs, data are generally stored in machine-readable form on disk or tape until the computer needs them.
  4. Procedures: Procedures are the policies that govern the operation of a computer system. "Procedures are to people what software is to hardware" is a common analogy that is used to illustrate the role of procedures in a system.
  5. People: Every system needs people if it is to be useful. Often the most overlooked element of the system are the people, probably the component that most influence the success or failure of information systems. This includes "not only the users, but those who operate and service the computers, those who maintain the data, and those who support the network of computers." <Kroenke, D. M. (2015). MIS Essentials. Pearson Education>
  6. Feedback: it is another component of the IS, that defines that an IS may be provided with a feedback (Although this component isn't necessary to function).

Data is the bridge between hardware and people. This means that the data we
collect is only data until we involve people. At that point, data is now
information.

## Types of information system[edit]

A four level

The "classic" view of Information systems found in the textbooks[18] in the
1980s was a pyramid of systems that reflected the hierarchy of the
organization, usually transaction processing systems at the bottom of the
pyramid, followed by management information systems, decision support systems,
and ending with executive information systems at the top. Although the pyramid
model remains useful since it was first formulated a number of new
technologies have been developed and new categories of information systems
have emerged, some of which no longer fit easily into the original pyramid
model.

Some examples of such systems are:

  * data warehouses
  * enterprise resource planning
  * enterprise systems
  * expert systems
  * search engines
  * geographic information system
  * global information system
  * office automation.

A **computer(-based) information system** is essentially an IS using computer
technology to carry out some or all of its planned tasks. The basic components
of computer-based information systems are:

  * _Hardware_ \- these are the devices like the monitor, processor, printer and keyboard, all of which work together to accept, process, show data and information.
  * _Software_ \- are the programs that allow the hardware to process the data.
  * _Databases_ \- are the gathering of associated files or tables containing related data.
  * _Networks_ \- are a connecting system that allows diverse computers to distribute resources.
  * _Procedures_ \- are the commands for combining the components above to process information and produce the preferred output.

The first four components (hardware, software, database, and network) make up
what is known as the information technology platform. Information technology
workers could then use these components to create information systems that
watch over safety measures, risk and the management of data. These actions are
known as information technology services.[19]

Certain information systems support parts of organizations, others support
entire organizations, and still others, support groups of organizations.
Recall that each department or functional area within an organization has its
own collection of application programs or information systems. These
functional area information systems (FAIS) are supporting pillars for more
general IS namely, business intelligence systems and dashboards[ _citation
needed_ ]. As the name suggest, each FAIS support a particular function within
the organization, e.g.: accounting IS, finance IS, production / operation
management (POM) IS, marketing IS, and human resources IS. In finance and
accounting, managers use IT systems to forecast revenues and business
activity, to determine the best sources and uses of funds, and to perform
audits to ensure that the organization is fundamentally sound and that all
financial reports and documents are accurate. Other types of organizational
information systems are FAIS, Transaction processing systems, enterprise
resource planning, office automation system, management information system,
decision support system, expert system, executive dashboard, supply chain
management system, and electronic commerce system. Dashboards are a special
form of IS that support all managers of the organization. They provide rapid
access to timely information and direct access to structured information in
the form of reports. Expert systems attempt to duplicate the work of human
experts by applying reasoning capabilities, knowledge, and expertise within a
specific domain.

## Information system development[edit]

Information technology departments in larger organizations tend to strongly
influence the development, use, and application of information technology in
the organizations. A series of methodologies and processes can be used to
develop and use an information system. Many developers now use an engineering
approach such as the system development life cycle (SDLC), which is a
systematic procedure of developing an information system through stages that
occur in sequence. Recent research aims at enabling[20] and measuring[21] the
ongoing, collective development of such systems within an organization by the
entirety of human actors themselves. An information system can be developed in
house (within the organization) or outsourced. This can be accomplished by
outsourcing certain components or the entire system.[22] A specific case is
the geographical distribution of the development team (offshoring, global
information system).

A computer-based information system, following a definition of Langefors,[23]
is a technologically implemented medium for:

  * recording, storing, and disseminating linguistic expressions,
  * as well as for drawing conclusions from such expressions.

Geographic information systems, land information systems, and disaster
information systems are examples of emerging information systems, but they can
be broadly considered as spatial information systems. System development is
done in stages which include:

  * Problem recognition and specification
  * Information gathering
  * Requirements specification for the new system
  * System design
  * System construction
  * System implementation
  * Review and maintenance.[24]

## As an academic discipline[edit]

See also: Information science, Information technology, and Information
management

The field of study called _information systems_ encompasses a variety of
topics including systems analysis and design, computer networking, information
security, database management and decision support systems. _Information
management_ deals with the practical and theoretical problems of collecting
and analyzing information in a business function area including business
productivity tools, applications programming and implementation, electronic
commerce, digital media production, data mining, and decision support.
_Communications and networking_ deals with the telecommunication technologies.
Information systems bridges business and computer science using the
theoretical foundations of information and computation to study various
business models and related algorithmic processes [25] on building the IT
systems [26][27] within a computer science
discipline.[28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40] **Computer
information system(s)** ( **CIS** ) is a field studying computers and
algorithmic processes, including their principles, their software and hardware
designs, their applications, and their impact on society,[41][42][43] whereas
IS emphasizes functionality over design.[44]

Several IS scholars have debated the nature and foundations of Information
Systems which have its roots in other reference disciplines such as Computer
Science, Engineering, Mathematics, Management Science, Cybernetics, and
others.[45][46][47][48] Information systems also can be defined as a
collection of hardware, software, data, people and procedures that work
together to produce quality information.

### Differentiating IS from related disciplines[edit]

Information Systems relationship to Information Technology, Computer Science,
Information Science, and Business.

Similar to computer science, other disciplines can be seen as both related and
foundation disciplines of IS. The domain of study of IS involves the study of
theories and practices related to the social and technological phenomena,
which determine the development, use, and effects of information systems in
organization and society.[49] But, while there may be considerable overlap of
the disciplines at the boundaries, the disciplines are still differentiated by
the focus, purpose, and orientation of their activities.[50]

In a broad scope, the term _Information Systems_ is a scientific field of
study that addresses the range of strategic, managerial, and operational
activities involved in the gathering, processing, storing, distributing, and
use of information and its associated technologies in society and
organizations.[50] The term information systems is also used to describe an
organizational function that applies IS knowledge in industry, government
agencies, and not-for-profit organizations.[50] _Information Systems_ often
refers to the interaction between algorithmic processes and technology. This
interaction can occur within or across organizational boundaries. An
information system is the technology an organization uses and also the way in
which the organizations interact with the technology and the way in which the
technology works with the organization’s business processes. Information
systems are distinct from information technology (IT) in that an information
system has an information technology component that interacts with the
processes' components.

One problem with that approach is that it prevents the IS field from being
interested in non-organizational use of ICT, such as in social networking,
computer gaming, mobile personal usage, etc. A different way of
differentiating the IS field from its neighbours is to ask, "Which aspects of
reality are most meaningful in the IS field and other fields?"[51] This
approach, based on philosophy, helps to define not just the focus, purpose and
orientation, but also the dignity, destiny and, responsibility of the field
among other fields. _International Journal of Information Management_ , 30,
13-20.

## Career pathways[edit]

Information Systems workers enter a number of different careers:

  * Information System Strategy
  * Management Information Systems
  * Project Management
  * Enterprise Architecture
  * IS Development
  * IS Organization
  * IS Consulting
  * IS Security
  * IS Auditor

There is a wide variety of career paths in the information systems discipline.
"Workers with specialized technical knowledge and strong communications skills
will have the best prospects. Workers with management skills and an
understanding of business practices and principles will have excellent
opportunities, as companies are increasingly looking to technology to drive
their revenue."[52]

Information technology is important to the operation of contemporary
businesses, it offers many employment opportunities. The information systems
field includes the people in organizations who design and build information
systems, the people who use those systems, and the people responsible for
managing those systems. The demand for traditional IT staff such as
programmers, business analysts, systems analysts, and designer is significant.
Many well-paid jobs exist in areas of Information technology. At the top of
the list is the chief information officer (CIO).

The CIO is the executive who is in charge of the IS function. In most
organizations, the CIO works with the chief executive officer (CEO), the chief
financial officer (CFO), and other senior executives. Therefore, he or she
actively participates in the organization's strategic planning process.

## Research[edit]

Information systems research is generally interdisciplinary concerned with the
study of the effects of information systems on the behaviour of individuals,
groups, and organizations.[53][54] Hevner et al. (2004)[55] categorized
research in IS into two scientific paradigms including _behavioural science_
which is to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or
organizational behavior and _design science_ which extends the boundaries of
human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative
artifacts.

Salvatore March and Gerald Smith[56] proposed a framework for researching
different aspects of Information Technology including outputs of the research
(research outputs) and activities to carry out this research (research
activities). They identified research outputs as follows:

  1. _Constructs_ which are concepts that form the vocabulary of a domain. They constitute a conceptualization used to describe problems within the domain and to specify their solutions.
  2. A _model_ which is a set of propositions or statements expressing relationships among constructs.
  3. A _method_ which is a set of steps (an algorithm or guideline) used to perform a task. Methods are based on a set of underlying constructs and a representation (model) of the solution space.
  4. An _instantiation_ is the realization of an artifact in its environment.

Also research activities including:

  1. _Build_ an artifact to perform a specific task.
  2. _Evaluate_ the artifact to determine if any progress has been achieved.
  3. Given an artifact whose performance has been evaluated, it is important to determine why and how the artifact worked or did not work within its environment. Therefore, _theorize_ and _justify_ theories about IT artifacts.

Although Information Systems as a discipline has been evolving for over 30
years now,[57] the core focus or identity of IS research is still subject to
debate among scholars.[58][59][60] There are two main views around this
debate: a narrow view focusing on the IT artifact as the core subject matter
of IS research, and a broad view that focuses on the interplay between social
and technical aspects of IT that is embedded into a dynamic evolving
context.[61] A third view[62] calls on IS scholars to pay balanced attention
to both the IT artifact and its context.

Since the study of information systems is an applied field, industry
practitioners expect information systems research to generate findings that
are immediately applicable in practice. This is not always the case however,
as information systems researchers often explore behavioral issues in much
more depth than practitioners would expect them to do. This may render
information systems research results difficult to understand, and has led to
criticism.[63]

In the last ten years, the business trend is represented by the considerable
increasing of Information Systems Function (ISF) role, especially with regard
the enterprise strategies and operations supporting. It became a key-factor to
increase productivity and to support new value creation.[64] To study an
information system itself, rather than its effects, information systems models
are used, such as EATPUT.

The international body of Information Systems researchers, the Association for
Information Systems (AIS), and its Senior Scholars Forum Subcommittee on
Journals (23 April 2007), proposed a 'basket' of journals that the AIS deems
as 'excellent', and nominated: _Management Information Systems Quarterly_
(MISQ), _Information Systems Research_ (ISR), _Journal of the Association for
Information Systems_ (JAIS), _Journal of Management Information Systems_
(JMIS), _European Journal of Information Systems_ (EJIS), and _Information
Systems Journal_ (ISJ).[65]

A number of annual information systems conferences are run in various parts of
the world, the majority of which are peer reviewed. The AIS directly runs the
International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS) and the Americas
Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS), while AIS affiliated
conferences[66] include the Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems
(PACIS), European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS), the Mediterranean
Conference on Information Systems (MCIS), the International Conference on
Information Resources Management (Conf-IRM) and the Wuhan International
Conference on E-Business (WHICEB). AIS chapter conferences[67] include
Australasian Conference on Information Systems (ACIS), Information Systems
Research Conference in Scandinavia (IRIS), Information Systems International
Conference (ISICO), Conference of the Italian Chapter of AIS (itAIS), Annual
Mid-Western AIS Conference (MWAIS) and Annual Conference of the Southern AIS
(SAIS). EDSIG,[68] which is the special interest group on education of the
AITP,[69] organizes the Conference on Information Systems and Computing
Education[70] and the Conference on Information Systems Applied Research[71]
which are both held annually in November.

In 1988, a degree program in Computer Information Systems (CIS) was launched with the objective of providing an option for students who were less inclined to become programmers and were more interested in learning to design, develop, and implement Information Systems, and solve business problems using the systems approach

ISSN 0001-0782.  Though the other components' connections to the software and their role in the overall design of the system are critical, the core consideration for a software-intensive system is the software itself, and other approaches to systematizing design have yet to solve the "software problem"—which won't be solved until software design is understood scientifically

It employs the philosophy of the late Herman Dooyeweerd to differentiate distinct aspects or 'spheres of meaning'. The paper suggests that while computer science finds the formative aspect, of shaping, structuring, processing, of central interest, and business and organizational fields find the economic and social aspects of central interest, the Information Systems field can find the lingual aspect of central interest, while making links with the aspects of the neighbouring disciplines.
