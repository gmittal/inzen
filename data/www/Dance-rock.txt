Dance-rock is a post-disco genre connected with pop rock and post-punk with fewer rhythm and blues influences, originated in the early 1980s, following the mainstream death of punk and disco.
Examples of early dance-rock include Gina X's "No G.D.M.", Russ Ballard's "On The Rebound", artists such as Dinosaur L, Liquid Liquid and Polyrock, and the compilation album Disco Not Disco.
