Entertainment law (or media law) is legal services to the entertainment industry. Entertainment law overlaps with intellectual property law (especially trademarks, copyright, and the "Right of Publicity"), but the practice of entertainment law often involves questions of employment law, contract law, torts, labor law, bankruptcy law, immigration, securities law, security interests, agency, right of privacy, defamation, advertising, criminal law, tax law, International law (especially Private international law), and insurance law.
Much of the work of an entertainment law practice is transaction based, i.e., drafting contracts, negotiation and mediation. Some situations may lead to litigation or arbitration.
